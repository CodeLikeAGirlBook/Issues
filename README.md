# Issues
Tech and coding is all about problem-solving. To help out readers of Code Like a Girl, I'll collect any issues and known problems here. 

This is what developers do, too. Look at any github repo and you'll see the Issues tab, where we keep lists of them. I'll help us out by listing some here, but click the Issues tab, above, one in from the left, and see what's going on. Don't see yours? Click the green New Issue button and let me know about it.
